Examples
========

The following example is included in the Bioperl app.  Save it to a
local file with:

    $ docker run bioperl-sci-app cat /examples/demo.pl > demo.pl

The file `demo.pl` contains the basic example:

    use Bio::Seq;
    use Bio::SeqIO;

    # create a sequence object of some DNA
    my $seq = Bio::Seq->new(-id => 'testseq', -seq => 'CATGTAGATAG');

    # print out some details about it
    print "seq is ", $seq->length, " bases long\n";
    print "revcom seq is ", $seq->revcom->seq, "\n";

    # write it to a file in Fasta format
    my $out = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => '>/data/testseq.fsa', -format => 'Fasta');
    $out->write_seq($seq);

Run it with:

    $ docker run -v $(pwd):/data bioperl-sci-app perl /data/demo.pl
    seq is 11 bases long
    revcom seq is CTATCTACATG

The demo should also create a file named `testseq.fsa` in the current
directory.
